# Text-Based-Adventure-1

This was the first game I made for my first course on video game design in first year (COMP1501) at Carleton Univeristy.
It is very simple in terms of techincal skills required but still a fun game and great exercise in world building.

## Requirements
Interpreter: Python 3.8

## Instructions
Game can be played in the Python Shell. :)
